## :speech_balloon: About this Project

The idea of the App is:
_How can we maintain the memory of participation and participation among members of a community?._


## :thinking: Why?

This project is part of a challenge I did to apply for a software developer position

"ReactBsB is a community of developers looking to exchange knowledge about front-end technologies and the entire JS universe. 

The community promotes periodic meetings involving several developers. 

How to give some prominence / notoriety to the most active members of this community?"
